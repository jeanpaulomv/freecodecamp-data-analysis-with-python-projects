# 📊 Data Analysis Projects with Python

## 📑 Overview
This repository contains projects and exercises from the "Data Analysis with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp, where I earned my certificate. These practical projects cover data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This collection is designed to enhance data analysis skills through hands-on examples and real-world applications.

## 🗂️ Projects Included
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques and methodologies for preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Application of statistical methods to analyze and interpret data, including hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and processing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting initial analysis to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights.
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Using statistical techniques and visualizations to perform in-depth analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Developing comprehensive visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
