# Data Analysis Projects with Python

## üìë Overview
This repository contains projects and exercises from the "Data Analysis with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp, where I earned my certificate. These practical projects cover data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This collection is designed to enhance data analysis skills through hands-on examples and real-world applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Projects Included
- **[Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/jeanpaulomv/freecodecamp-data-analysis-with-python-projects/tree/1aaae1d5ff5e48d9013ed5969c494fc0f574059e/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer)**: Analysis of demographic data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **[Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/jeanpaulomv/freecodecamp-data-analysis-with-python-projects/tree/de59ba40cafedffa03ce4b93ecb6258e16f4070d/Mean-Variance-Standard%20Deviation%20Calculator)**: Calculation of fundamental statistical metrics to understand data distribution.

- **[Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/jeanpaulomv/freecodecamp-data-analysis-with-python-projects/tree/de59ba40cafedffa03ce4b93ecb6258e16f4070d/Sea%20Level%20Predictor)**: Predictive analysis of sea level changes based on historical data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and processing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting initial analysis to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights.
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Using statistical techniques and visualizations to perform in-depth analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Developing comprehensive visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

## üîß Skills Utilized
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
- **Python**: Programming language used for all analysis and visualization tasks.

## üìö Key Learnings
- **Data Preparation**: Mastery of techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Enhanced ability to create detailed and informative visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Increased capacity to apply statistical methods and interpret complex datasets.
