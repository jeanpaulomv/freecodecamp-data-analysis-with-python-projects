# üìä Data Analysis Projects with Python

## üìë Overview
This repository contains projects and exercises from the "Data Analysis with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp, where I earned my certificate. These practical projects cover data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This collection is designed to enhance data analysis skills through hands-on examples and real-world applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Projects Included
- **[Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/jeanpaulomv/freecodecamp-data-analysis-with-python-projects/tree/1aaae1d5ff5e48d9013ed5969c494fc0f574059e/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer)**: Analysis of demographic data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **[Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](path/to/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)**: Calculation of fundamental statistical metrics to understand data distribution.
- **[Medical Data Visualizer](path/to/medical-data-visualizer)**: Visualization of medical data to identify trends and anomalies.
- **[Page View Time Series Visualizer](path/to/page-view-time-series-visualizer)**: Visualization of time series data to track page view trends over time.
- **[Sea Level Predictor](path/to/sea-level-predictor)**: Predictive analysis of sea level changes based on historical data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and processing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting initial analysis to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights.
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Using statistical techniques and visualizations to perform in-depth analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Developing comprehensive visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
